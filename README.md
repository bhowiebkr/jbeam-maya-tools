# JBeam Maya Tools

JBeam maya tools goal is to use Maya as a mod editor for generating digital assets for the game BeamNG. This tools has been put on hold due to other priorities. Feel free to fork and continue on implementing this if you wish

Main features in this small code base that can be of use are as follows:

- Visualize the nodes and beams found in the jbeam file format inside of Autodesk Maya.
- Successfully parse all official jbeam files into valid json files. This is done using regular expressions to cover all known edge cases.

More information of the jbeam file format can be found on the [Wiki](https://wiki.beamng.com/JBeam)

Below are examples of jbeam files converted and loaded into Maya:
